# My World

My World is a (fantasy) map editor. Unlike other editors (Inkarnate, Wonderdraft, etc.) the maps are vector graphics
instead of raster graphics. This means that they do not have a fixed resolution and no maximum size (well, the size
is limited by the range of floating point numbers, but you know ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯).

## Features

For now the planned features are:
- [ ] Geometry (i.e. the landmasses and water bodies)
- [ ] Rivers
- [ ] Elevation (i.e. mountains and hills)
- [ ] Landscape (i.e. forests, deserts, etc.)
- [ ] Cities and Roads
- [ ] Borders and Labels

## Development

myworld is written in Python3 and uses the customtkinter library. The project is in a very early stage and the
application is not usable yet.
